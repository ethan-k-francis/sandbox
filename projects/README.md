# Projects

All sandbox experiments and learning projects live here. Each project is its own
self-contained folder with its own dependencies, build system, and documentation.

## Projects Index

| Project | Language | Description | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| `_example-python-cli/` | Python | Reference project — CLI tool with proper packaging | Template |
| `_example-go-api/` | Go | Reference project — HTTP API with standard layout | Template |

## How to Add a Project

1. Create a folder: `mkdir projects/my-experiment`
2. Copy structure from one of the `_example-*` projects (or build from scratch)
3. Add a README.md (required)
4. Add a row to the table above

See the [repo README](../README.md) for full instructions on Python, Go, and other languages.
