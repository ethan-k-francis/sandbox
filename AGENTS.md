# Project context for AI and humans

This repo is a **sandbox** — used for **learning**, **experimentation**, and **prototyping**. It's the place to try things out, build quick proofs of concept, and explore new ideas without worrying about production readiness.

- **Learning:** Prefer teachable, step-by-step approaches. Explain the "why" and tie to principles (80/20, security, SOLID, etc.) when relevant.
- **Portfolio:** Code and docs should be something the owner is comfortable showing; keep quality and security high even in experiments.
- **Experimentation:** This is the place to try new languages, libraries, patterns, and tools. Move fast, but keep things documented so you can come back and understand what you built.

## Code Quality: Comments and Documentation

- **All code must have educational comments.** Someone learning to code should be able to read any file and understand what every section does and why.
- **Every directory must have a README.md.** No exceptions for meaningful directories (experiments, modules, tools, scripts).

## Preferences

- Security is non-negotiable.
- Prefer 80/20 and best practices.
- Preferred languages: Go, Python, C++, C#, Rust, TypeScript.
- Performance-first: pick the right data structures from the start.
- Feature branches and PRs for all changes (never push to main directly).
- Branch prefix: `efrancis/feature/descriptive-name`.
